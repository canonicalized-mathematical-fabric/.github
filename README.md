# Canonicalized Mathematical Fabric (CMF)

> A fractal, verifiable, unbounded mathematical reasoning framework.

We treat mathematical discovery as an auditable, stateful, long-horizon process instead of a one-shot inference.  
Decompose → Distill → Solve → Verify → Synthesize → Escrow unknown proofs for later.
